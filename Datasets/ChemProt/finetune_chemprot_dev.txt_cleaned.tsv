We found that ** glycine ** is released from vesicles when ## VIAAT ## is coexpressed with either the neuronal transporter GlyT2 or the glial transporter GlyT1.	SUBSTRATE
However, GlyT2 was more effective than GlyT1, probably because GlyT2 is unable to operate in the reverse mode, which gives it an advantage in maintaining the high cytosolic ** glycine ** concentration required for efficient vesicular loading by ## VIAAT ##.	SUBSTRATE

Interestingly, the VIAAT ortholog from Caenorhabditis elegans (UNC-47), a species lacking glycine transmission, also supports ** glycine ** exocytosis in the presence of ## GlyT2 ##, and a point mutation of UNC-47 that abolishes GABA transmission in the worm confers glycine specificity.	SUBSTRATE
