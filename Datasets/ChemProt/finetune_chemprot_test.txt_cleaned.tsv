Blockade of ** LTC4 ** synthesis caused by additive inhibition of ## gIV-PLA2 ## phosphorylation: Effect of salmeterol and PDE4 inhibition in human eosinophils.	PRODUCT-OF
OBJECTIVE: To determine (a) whether ** PDE4 ** inhibition alone with ## rolipram ## blocked secretions of arachidonic acid (AA) and leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) caused by activation of eosinophils with formyl-met-leu-phe plus cytochalasin B (FMLP/B), (b) to determine if PDE4 inhibition plus beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist act additively to augment endogenous cAMP concentration, and (c) to determine the mechanism by which additive inhibition of AA and LTC(4) synthesis is regulated by cAMP.

RESULTS: Rolipram unmasked the inhibitory effect of ** beta(2)-adrenoceptor ** stimulation with ## salmeterol ## and significantly attenuated the stimulated release of AA and subsequent LTC(4).	ACTIVATOR
Inhibition corresponded to increased cAMP production caused by rolipram alone or ** rolipram ** plus salmeterol and blocked proportionately the phosphorylation and activation of ## gIV-PLA(2) ## in FMLP/B-activated eosinophils.	INHIBITOR

ANTAGONIST
Saturation and competition studies in the presence or absence of the ** histamine H1 receptor ** antagonist, ## levocabastine ##, revealed that [3H]SR 142948A bound with similar affinities to both the levocabastine-insensitive neurotensin NT1 receptors (20% of the total binding population) and the recently cloned levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin NT2 receptors (80% of the receptors) (Kd = 6.8 and 4.8 nM, respectively).
