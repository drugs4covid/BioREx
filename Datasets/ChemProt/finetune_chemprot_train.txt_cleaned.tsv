Treatment of Rat-2 fibroblast cells with ** C2-ceramide ** caused the stimulation of ## c-fos SRE ##-dependent reporter gene activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner by transient transfection analysis.	ACTIVATOR
Next, we examined the role of Rho family GTPases in the ** ceramide **-induced signalling to ## SRE ## activation.	ACTIVATOR
By reporter gene analysis following transient transfections with various plasmids expressing a dominant negative mutant form of Cdc42, Rac1 or RhoA, ** C2-ceramide **-induced ## SRE ## activation was shown to be selectively repressed by pEXV-RacN17 encoding a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, suggesting that Rac activity is essential for the signalling cascade of ceramide to the nucleus.	ACTIVATOR
In a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of Rac in the ceramide-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with mepacrine, a potent and specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or co-transfection with antisense cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) oligonucleotide repressed the ** C2-ceramide **-induced ## SRE ## activation selectively, implying a critical role of cPLA2 in C2-ceramide-induced signalling to nucleus.

Consistent with these results, the translocation of cPLA2 protein as well as the release of ** arachidonic acid **, a principal product of ## phospholipase A2 ##, was rapidly induced by the addition of C2-ceramide in a Rac-dependent manner.	PRODUCT-OF
